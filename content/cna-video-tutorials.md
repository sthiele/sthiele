I created some video tutorials for [CellNetAnalyzer](https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html), 
the software we develop at work.
I uploaded the first video to youtube.

The video was captured using [simplescreenrecorder](http://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/),
for the voice over I used a text to speech system,
and the video editing was done with [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org).
