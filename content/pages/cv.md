### Applications and Software

* [`meneco`](https://github.com/bioasp/meneco) - A tool to compute optimal extensions for a metabolic network.
* [`iggy`](https://github.com/bioasp/iggy) - Tools for the consistency based analysis (consistency check, diagnosis, repair and prediction) of influence graphs models and experimental observations.
* [`exdesi`](https://github.com/bioasp/exdesi) - Design experiments to differentiate interaction graph models.
* [`ingranalyze`](https://github.com/bioasp/ingranalyze) - The precursor of Iggy computes the minimal inconsistent core (MIC) of an influence graph model.
* [`precursor`](https://github.com/bioasp/precursor) - A tool to compute minimal sets of precursor metabolites necessary to produce targets metabolites.
* [`pyasp`](https://github.com/sthiele/pyasp) - A convenience wrapper for the ASP tools gringo, clasp, claspD.
